## Overview

The `ndarray-base-unary-reduce-subarray-by` repository provides a powerful tool for performing reductions on multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays) in JavaScript. This library allows you to reduce a specified list of dimensions in an input ndarray using a callback function, with the results assigned to a designated output ndarray.

### Features

- **Flexible Reductions**: Choose dimensions for reduction and specify your callback function.
- **Efficient Performance**: Built for speed, this library optimizes memory and processing.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js and modern JavaScript environments.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that integrates well with existing projects.

## Installation

To get started, you can install the package via npm. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-unary-reduce-subarray-by
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the library:

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-subarray-by');

// Create an ndarray
const input = ndarray(new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), [2, 3]);

// Prepare an output ndarray
const output = ndarray(new Float32Array(2), [2]);

// Define a callback function for reduction
const callback = (accumulator, value) => accumulator + value;

// Perform the reduction
reduce(input, output, callback, [1]);

console.log(output); // Outputs the reduced values
```

### Parameters

- **input**: The input ndarray you want to reduce.
- **output**: The ndarray where results will be stored.
- **callback**: A function that defines how to combine values.
- **dimensions**: An array of dimensions to reduce.

## Topics

This repository touches on several important topics in array manipulation and functional programming:

- **Accumulate**: Build up results over specified dimensions.
- **Accumulation**: Gather values into a single result.
- **Array**: Work with multi-dimensional data structures.
- **Base**: Core functionality for ndarray operations.
- **JavaScript**: Built for the JavaScript ecosystem.
- **Node.js**: Optimized for server-side applications.
- **Reduce**: Functional programming technique for combining values.
- **Reduction**: The process of simplifying data.
- **Stdlib**: Utilizes standard libraries for efficiency.
- **Strided**: Handles data with non-contiguous memory layouts.
- **Subarray**: Work with slices of larger arrays.
- **Unary**: Focuses on single-argument functions.
